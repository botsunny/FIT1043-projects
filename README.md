This repository collects the reports (as well as the Jupyter Notebook files to generate them) I wrote for two of the assignments given in FIT1043 - Introduction to data science at Monash University.

# Assignment 1

This assignment involves the descriptive analysis of life expectancy, population and gross domestic product (GDP) in Southeast Asian countries.

# Assignment 2

This assignment involves the predictive analysis of essay scores using machine learning. A support vector machine (SVM) is created to predict essay scores, which is then evaluated via the quadratic weighted kappa (QWK) score metric and submitted for an in-class Kaggle competition.
